# syntax/mutations.md

Principles: 1, 6, 7 (engine owns tx boundary).

## Same shape as queries, body writes
Named, typed, callable. Generates a client method + endpoint (calling.md).
```
mutation place_order(org: Id, buyer: Id) -> OrderCard {
  create Order { org = $org, placed_by = $buyer };
}
```

## Actions
- `create Model { field = $in, ... }`
- `update Model where (...) { field = $in }`
- `delete Model where (...)` — on a soft-delete model, rewritten to the soft action, never real DELETE.
- `restore Model where (...)`
- `hard delete Model where (...)` — explicit, loud opt-out for real DELETE.

## Atomic groups
`tx { ... }` runs a static set of writes in one transaction; rolls back together. Back-reference a prior step with `^`:
```
tx {
  create User { email = $email };
  create Address { user = ^.id, city = $city };
}
```

## Read-decide-write
Not in the DSL. Use the host-language `transaction(closure)` seam: engine owns the boundary (commit on Ok, rollback on Err/panic, always release); caller writes logic; inside, queries are the same safe queries bound to the tx. See architecture docs.
